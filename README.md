Create the virtual environment: `python -m venv [VE dir name e.g. 've_py3']`
Activate the virtual environment: `ve_py3\Scripts\activate.bat` (Command Prompt) or `ve_py3\Scripts\activate.ps1` (Powershell)
Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To launch: `python stratvis.py`

Exit the virtual environment: `deactivate`
